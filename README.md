# Goibibo Flight Data Scraping and SQL Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves web scraping flight data from Goibibo.com and performing SQL analysis on the collected dataset. The project revolves around extracting relevant flight information, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and utilizing SQL queries to gain insights into flights between Chennai and New Delhi.

## Project Overview

This project encompasses several key steps, each contributing to a comprehensive analysis of the flight data:

1. **Web Scraping:** I utilized the Listly web scraping tool to extract detailed flight data from Goibibo for a specific date and route.

2. **Data Cleaning:** After obtaining the data, I conducted thorough data cleaning, addressing missing values and formatting inconsistencies.

3. **SQL Analysis:** Leveraging SQL queries, I posed a series of questions to the data and performed exploratory analysis to derive meaningful insights.

## Web Scraping with Listly

I gathered flight data for economy class flights on September 29, 2023, between Chennai International airport and Indira Gandhi International Airport. Listly proved to be a valuable tool for web scraping.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset were done in Microsoft Excel. Key tasks undertaken in this phase include:

- Handling Missing Values: Addressing null values through imputation or exclusion.

- Standardizing Time Formats: Converting time-related columns (Departure_Time, Arrival_Time, Layover_Duration) to a consistent format.

- Formatting Duration: Splitting the Total_Duration column into Total_Duration_Hours and Total_Duration_Minutes for granular analysis.

## SQL Analysis

The core of this project lies in SQL analysis, where I formulated queries to extract insightful information from the flight data. Key analysis points include:

1. **Average Price:** Determining the average price of flights from Chennai to New Delhi.

2. **Cheapest and Expensive Flights:** Identifying airlines offering the cheapest and most expensive flights for the route.

3. **Flight Duration Distribution:** Visualizing the distribution of flight durations for the selected route.

4. **Flights with Layovers:** Analyzing layover cities' prevalence and duration for flights on this route.

5. **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating potential correlations between flight duration and price.

6. **Effect of Free Meals and Layovers:** Exploring how the availability of free meals and layovers affects flight prices.

7. **Airline Frequency:** Identifying airlines with the highest number of flights on the Chennai-New Delhi route.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my proficiency in web scraping, data cleaning, and SQL analysis. By applying these skills to real-world flight data, I extracted meaningful insights that can benefit travelers and airlines alike.

## Repository Purpose

I created this GitHub repository to share my Goibibo Flight Data Scraping and SQL Analysis project. The repository serves as an example of my data manipulation and analysis skills, providing potential employers and collaborators with a tangible demonstration of my capabilities.
